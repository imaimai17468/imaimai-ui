    "problem": "Select appropriate technology stack for building a shadcn/ui-compatible component registry with optimal performance and developer experience",
    "constraints": [
      "Must be compatible with shadcn CLI",

  "decision": {
    "summary": "Use Next.js 16, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS v4, Biome, Vitest, and Bun as the core technology stack",
    "details": "Next.js 16 provides App Router with Server Components for optimal performance and SEO. TypeScript ensures type safety across the codebase. Tailwind CSS v4 offers modern utility-first styling. Biome replaces ESLint+Prettier for faster linting and formatting. Vitest provides fast unit testing. Bun offers faster package management and script execution. Radix UI primitives power the shadcn/ui components.",

        "option": "Remix",
        "rejected": true,
        "reason": "Less ecosystem support and shadcn compatibility compared to Next.js"

      "Excellent performance with Server Components",
      "Strong type safety with TypeScript strict mode",
      "Fast development workflow with Bun",
      "Unified linting/formatting with Biome",
