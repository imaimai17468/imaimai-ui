    "constraints": [
      "Next.js 16 App Router conventions",
      "shadcn/ui registry compatibility",

  "decision": {
    "summary": "Use feature-based directory organization with kebab-case directories and PascalCase component files",
    "details": "The project follows a feature-based organization where components are organized by their role: registry (public components), docs (documentation components), shared (common UI elements), and ui (shadcn/ui base components). Directory names use kebab-case while component files use PascalCase to match the component name.",

        "option": "Type-based organization (atoms/molecules/organisms)",
        "rejected": true,
        "reason": "Less intuitive for component registry use case"

    "rationale": "Feature-based organization provides clear separation of concerns and makes it easy to locate files. The naming convention follows React and Next.js community standards.",
    "consequences": [
      "Easy to locate components by feature",
